      React components implement a render() method that takes input data and
      returns what to display. This example uses an XML-like syntax called JSX.
      Input data that is passed into the component can be accessed by render()
      via this.props. JSX is optional and not required to use React. Try the
      Babel REPL to see the raw JavaScript code produced by the JSX compilation
      step.
